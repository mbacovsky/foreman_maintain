# Pulp Server Configuration
# =========================

# The settings in this file are all commented by default, and the commented settings show the
# default values that Pulp Server will choose if not specified here.

# -- Common Configuration -----------------------------------------------------

# = Database =
#
# Controls the behavior of MongoDB under Pulp's usage.
#
# Authentication - If the username and the password keys have values provided,
# the pulp server will attempt to authenticate to the MongoDB server.  The
# username and password provided here will be used to authenticate with the
# database specified in the name field.
#
# Replica Sets - If more than one seed is provided, a connection will be attempted to each seed
# until a connection is made. When multiple seeds are provided, the 'replica_set' value must also
# be specified.
#
# name:              name of the database to use
# seeds:             comma-separated list of hostname:port of database replica seed hosts
# username:          The user name to use for authenticating to the MongoDB server
# password:          The password to use for authenticating to the MongoDB server
# replica_set:       uncomment and set this value to the name of replica set configured in MongoDB,
#                    if one is in use
# ssl:               If True, create the connection to the server using SSL.
# ssl_keyfile:       A path to the private keyfile used to identify the local connection against
#                    mongod. If included with the certfile then only the ssl_certfile is needed.
# ssl_certfile:      The certificate file used to identify the local connection against mongod.
# verify_ssl:        Specifies whether a certificate is required from the other side of the
#                    connection, and whether it will be validated if provided. If it is true, then
#                    the ca_cert parameter must point to a file of CA certificates used to
#                    validate the connection.
# ca_path:           The ca_certs file contains a set of concatenated “certification authority”
#                    certificates, which are used to validate certificates passed from the other end
#                    of the connection.
# unsafe_autoretry:  If true, retry commands to the database if there is a connection error.
#                    Warning: if set to true, this setting can result in duplicate records.
# write_concern:     Write concern of 'majority' or 'all'. When 'all' is specified, 'w' is set to
#                    number of seeds specified. For version of MongoDB < 2.6, replica_set must also
#                    be specified. Please note that 'all' will cause Pulp to halt if any of the
#                    replica set members is not available. 'majority' is used by defau
